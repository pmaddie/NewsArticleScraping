# News Article Scraping


### Overview

In this application, you'll be able to let users view and leave comments on the latest news. Instead of actually writing any articles; The news articles I chose to scrape come from (TheVerge.com)[theverge.com]. You use Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape news from another site by pressing the "scrape" button. 



Included in the npm packages are : 

   1. express

   2. express-handlebars

   3. mongoose

   4. cheerio

   5. axios

which you will run `npm install` upon opening the application.
